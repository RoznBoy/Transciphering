# Transciphering
Transciphering enables the encryption of data using symmetric block ciphers, which can then be transmitted and stored in the cloud at moderate costs.
Subsequently, the encrypted data can be moved to a computing service that employs FHE. Through transciphering, the service effectively “replaces” the encryption scheme from symmetric encryption to FHE encryption. Once the data is encrypted using FHE, the service can perform computations on it and return the results to the user or store them for future use.
